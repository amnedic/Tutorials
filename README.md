### 1. Classical Monte Carlo methods for studying the spin models

In this tutorial, we will study the physics of the Ising model far away and close to the critical temperature, using Monte Carlo algorithms. These algorithms are very general and can be easily extended to other spin systems, such as the XY or the Heisenberg models.

#### Requirements

* Programming Language: `Python`
* Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `random`

#### Overview

- Aim 1: Study the Ising model within the *local Metropolis algorithm* - obtaining a groundstate and calculating energy, magnetization, specific heat and susceptibility.
- Aim 2: introducing two upgraded Monte Carlo approaches *heat bath* and *Wolf cluster algorithm* 

#### Acknowledgements

This tutorial is motivated by the lectures and homeworks in the course of *Numerical Physics* given by Professor [Alberto Rosso](https://lptms.u-psud.fr/alberto_rosso/).
